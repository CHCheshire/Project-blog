# The Hobby Corner 
 
The Hobby Corner is a blog webiste for my interests: On there, as a superuser, I can make posts about topics that I like and autheticated users can contact me and comment and like posts as well. It's overall quite simple in it's design but the website works to be what I want it to be, a blog for myself.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  There's a nav bar at the top of the screen to got to the different screens, so from here you can go to the homepage, sort out accounts and, once autheticated, contact me as well

- __The blog posts__

  From here you can see all the different blog posts that have been made, I add these posts manually through Django Admin. The posts have the image as the masthead as well as the image showing on the posts itself. From here, you can see the likes and comments on a post as well.

- __Warhammer:40,000 section__

  This section is here to go into details on the universe of Warhammer 40,000; To describe what it's like, what humanity is like in this setting and the other alien and demonic races within it as well. This is meant to inform the user in greater detail compared to the brief overview from the What is Warhammer section that precedes it.
